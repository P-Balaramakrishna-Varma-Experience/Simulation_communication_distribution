# Simulation_communication_distribution
This repo is for simulation of communication cost and distribution efficiency of different minimizers and hash based approach.


# learning
- interface choice (where to use (what all available), what all needed to run)

- work simplistic (do not work for future tasks complicating)
    - cannot consider all things that are there. 
    - no progress in the strart (not that recomended in software)
    - Changes to correct code are common (go with the task)

- Debugging why something is happening
    - guessing randomly (frustrating)
    - guessing based on data (scientific)
        - all data (collect linearly) [overlkill sometimes]
        - do binary search 

- Desing and implemntation of small code
    - composition structed programming composition.
    - error in composstiion. (idea is not correct)
    - error in implementation idea step correct but did not implement that step correctly.
    - check the abstract constructs which are beings used ? correctly??

- verify results
